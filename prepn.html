      <h2>Prep'n</h2>
      <p>Prep’n was a lesson in functionality and simplicity in design. When prompted to create a recipe app, I was excited because I had some bad experiences with similar apps in the past and knew exactly what I would like to see made. I decided to create an app specifically geared towards meal prepping. Meal prepping is a way of preparing meals in one day for the week ahead. It saves time and just as importantly, it helps people achieve their fitness goals by structuring what they eat as well as portion sizes. I felt that people might like the idea of meal prepping, but need assistance in getting the right information, recipes that would work for their goals, and help structuring their meals.

      <p>The app takes into account the user’s dietary preferences, weight goals, and daily macronutrient requirements. It also offers a catalogue of tasty, but healthy recipes and video instruction on how to prepare them all in one day. The user is able to select a meal they want for the week knowing that it adheres to their diet and macronutritional needs. In addition, there is a social aspect to the app where users can post motivational quotes, progress pictures of themselves, and even share original recipe creations!
      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>Here is a video walkthrough along with a link to the prototype for Prep'n!</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>
When starting out with designing Prep’n, I went and checked out a few cooking apps as well as some weight loss trackers. I knew I wanted to fuse the recipe features of a cooking app with the health and fitness focus of weight loss trackers. I looked at three main apps: Mealime, Kitchen Stories, and Lose it! Mealime had a really helpful way of providing grocery lists, which I found intriguing, but I wasn’t a big fan of the app from a visual perspective. I liked Kitchen Stories use of video content and the way it presented elegant, classy photos in a clear and easy to navigate manner. My favorite feature of the Lose It! was it’s
macronutrient and calorie tracker. Users are able to input their meals and follow the nutrition of what they are putting in their bodies thought the day, as well as factor in calories they burned through exercise. Since Prepn’ was geared towards helping people save time and achieve fitness goals, I wanted to give its users a similar feature.
</p>
<p>Prepn’ is supposed to be an app that inspires, but more importantly invokes a sense of health and wellbeing. With this in mind, I wanted to choose a color scheme that feels being in the kitchen. I chose a soft green and a light khaki as my primary colors. I felt that it created a since of soothing wellness of time in the kitchen paired with the freshness of the produce section.</p>

      <p>Prepn’ involved the creation of a few user personas as well. I knew that my target demographic was adults aged 25 and up that are busy with work or school, but have a desire to be healthy without a lot of time to cook. I created three user personas. The first was a 27 year old male Programmer named Greg Peterson. Greg is at the age where he’s noticing some weight gain and wants to do something about it. He’s not the most experienced cook in the world and is new to healthy eating. Prepn’ is perfect for Greg because it offers a lot of step by step video instruction and a way to track the food he is consuming without him having to think too much about it.</p>

      <p>The next user persona, Cindy Jacobs, is a 33 year old speech pathologist with a love for fitness, but a schedule that can’t be tamed. Cindy is an ambitious career woman who is in a relationship. She doesn’t have the time to cook three meals a day and often resorts to meal bars as a way to save time without cheating her diet. Prepn’ gives Cindy the strategy to cook meals all in one day and schedule them out for the week ahead. This saves Cindy the time and hassle of thinking about what she will eat on a work day and allows her to know she’s already got a nutritious, healthy option available when she needs it.</p>

      <p>Finally, there is Mellany Got. Mellany is a recently retired art teacher who wants to spend her later years traveling and enjoying herself. She has health concerns that mean chemist eat a healthier diet and also wants to save money in the process. Meal prepping is attractive to her because she can prepare her food for the week and enjoy a nice road trip with her meals in a freezer without spending a lot of money on restaurants where she would eat calorie rich foods that aren’t good for her.</p>

      <p>When it came time to design the app, I knew that nice images were crucial to creating an appealing world. My home screen keeps things simple with a list of the user’s meals for the day that they can check as they eat throughout the day. At the top of the screen I placed the user’s profile photo along with a status bar that allows the user to quickly and easily post an update to their social feed in order to show off those fitness gains or post an inspiring message! I created a bottom navigation bar that included the four key features of the app: the home screen, recipe library, the users meal plans, and the social feed. In addition to these, I included a plus icon that , when tapped, brings up a menu where the user can either input exercise they did that day, create a recipe to be shared with the community, or input a snack that they had in addition to their planned meals. I kept the recipe library simple and to the point, giving the user a recipe suggestion that fits their taste and nutritional goals, followed by highly rated recipes. The search bar at the top makes it easy for a user to find a recipe they have in mind along with user ratings located at the top of every result to make selecting a good recipe easier. The “My Plan” section of the app is a bit more technical. It features a calendar that has information about scheduled meals for upcoming weeks and when to prepare them. It also includes a chart that displays the user’s progress towards their goal weight. In addition, this is where the user can find their upcoming grocery list for the week based on the meals they had scheduled to prepare.</p>

      <p>With Prepn’ saving time and eating well has never been easier. It’s an app that educates people about the process of meal prepping while helping the to achieve their goals in an informed and guided journey to health and wellbeing!
